# SonycProject
This project is the frontend and core data for the Sounds of New York (SONYC) Project where we are helping to mitigate noise pollution in urban cities. Audio samples are taken in from the mircophone and analzyed to determine the level of noise that the user is recording. The user will be able to make a report and send the issue to 311.
